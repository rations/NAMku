# Master geometry and palette for the NAMku editor art. Sourced by
# make_assets.sh; the same numbers are mirrored as constants in
# source/namgeometry.h (keep the two in sync). All values are FINAL (1x)
# pixels — the canvas is drawn 1:1 on Haiku's app_server.
#
# Layout mirrors the original Neural Amp Modeler amp-head panel (600x400):
# a row of six knobs under the title, two toggle switches, a model row and an
# IR row near the bottom, and input/output level meters on the outer edges.
# The raster layers below are the plugin's own MIT-licensed art (see
# gui/README); knob pointers/arcs, meter fills, switch handles and the small
# functional glyphs are drawn in code, exactly as the original does.
